Building the Web Deploy Package
===============================

# Install the `Microsoft Web Platform Installer  (WebPI)
  <http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx>`_.

  Skip this if you've already done it and haven't changed anything since.

# Use the WebPI to install dependencies.

  Skip this if you've already done it and haven't changed anything since.

  Install the ``PyPI`` package for ``pip`` and all of it's
  dependencies including Python and distribute.  Also install Web
  Matrix.  Note that you can install multiple packages at once so no
  need to do this in two steps.

# Clone `Installers-UnifiedInstaller
  <https://github.com/plone/Installers-UnifiedInstaller>`_

  Skip this if you've already done it and haven't changed anything since.

  Using a `windows git client <http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/>`_.

# TODO Create the buildout::

      > cd Installers-UnifiedInstaller
      > C:\Python2.7\python.exe platforms\webpi\TODO.py PloneWebDeployPackage

   Make buildout-cache/eggs, buildout-cache/downloads

   Run "C:\Installers-UnifiedInstaller>C:\Python26\python.exe helper_scripts\create_inst ance.py C:\Installers-UnifiedInstaller C:\Installers-UnifiedInstaller zeocluster xen xen act1v4t3 0 1 0 0 cluster C:\Installers-UnifiedInstaller\install.log 2 ß€"

# Run the buildout::

      > cd PloneWebDeployPackage
      > C:\Python2.7\python.exe bootstrap.py -d
      > bin\buildout.exe -N -c develop.cfg

  We use develop.cfg to make sure we have all the eggs the user may
  need including develop tools.

# Create the Web Deploy zip package::

      > C:\Python2.7\python.exe setup.py sdist --formats=tar -k

  Then open a file browser, select ``Manifest.xml``,
  ``Parameters.xml`` and ``PloneInstaller-4-2``, then right-click and
  Select "Send to -> Compressed (zipped) Folder".

      TODO> C:\Python2.7\python.exe setup.py bdist_msdeploy

# TODO Test with msdeploy

# Update the Web PI atom feed

  # Update the SHA1 hash

    Install `fciv.exe
    <http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/f/4/cf454ae0-a4bb-4123-8333-a1b6737712f7/windows-kb841290-x86-enu.exe>`_
    (skip this if you've already done it and know where ``fciv.exe``
    is).

    Then use it to `display the SHA1 hash
    <http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/1082/web-deploy-parameterization/>`_::

        > fciv.exe -sha1 Parameters.zip

    Copy the printed hash and replace the existing one in
    ``Installers-UnifiedInstaller\platforms\webpi\web-pi.xml``.

  # Update the package size

     Use use the file browser to get the package size in KB replace
     the existing one in
     ``Installers-UnifiedInstaller\platforms\webpi\web-pi.xml``.

# Test with WebPI
 
  # Point WebPI to the local feed

    Skip this if you've already done it and haven't changed anything since.

    Force WebPI to use the modified feed.  Use the WebPI options screen
    to remove any previous Plone installer feeds and adding
    ``file:///C:/...Installers-UnifiedInstaller/platforms/webpi/web-pi.xml``
    replacing ``...`` with the appropriate path.  Then delete it's cache
    of feeds by deleting all ``*.xml`` files in
    ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\xen\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Web
    Platform Installer`` (``%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application
    Data\Microsoft\Web Platform Installer`` on Windows XP).

  # Point WebPI to the local package

    You can skip this if you've done it before and the new package is
    in the same place as the file URL points to.

    Replace the ``<installerURL>`` element contents in
    ``Installers-UnifiedInstaller\platforms\webpi\web-pi.xml`` with
    ``file:///C:/.../Parameters.zip`` replacing ``...`` with the
    appropriate path.  This will make the WebPI install your archive
    and not the current one online.

  # TODO Install the new package with WebPI

  # TODO Test with WebMatrix
